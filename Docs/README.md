# Introduction

This documentation attempts to describe the fundamentals of an alternate user interface and composition framework.

A modern user interface framework needs to be beautiful, expressive and consistently performant. It must allow for the creation of user interfaces that adapt themselves to various form factors and interaction models. The building blocks of such a framework must be flexible enough that the developer can express a unique artistic vision while still allowing for this finely crafted interaction with the user to seamlessly fit into the larger ecosystem.

These are the core tenets of Radar. How closely and/or successfully these have been adhered to are up to you to decide.
